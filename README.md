## 🫀 Heart Disease Risk Factor Analysis
### CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship - Prudence Chebet

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship Program**.
It involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization of the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** to identify key risk factors associated with heart disease.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository — Heart Disease Dataset
- **Size:** 303 patients, 14 features
- **Target Variable:** Heart Disease (1 = Has Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease)
### Features:
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Age | Patient age in years |
| Sex | Gender (Male/Female) |
| Chest Pain Type | Type of chest pain experienced |
| Resting Blood Pressure | Resting BP in mmHg |
| Cholesterol | Serum cholesterol in mg/dl |
| Fasting Blood Sugar | Whether fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl |
| Max Heart Rate | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| ST Depression | Exercise induced ST depression |
| Major Vessels Count | Number of major vessels |
| Heart Disease | Diagnosis (target variable) |

## 🔍 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
 
### Research Questions:
1. Does age increase the risk of heart disease?
2. Are males or females more at risk?
3. Does high cholesterol contribute to heart disease?
4. Does chest pain type predict heart disease?
5. Does maximum heart rate differ between patients with and without heart disease?
6. Which factors are most strongly correlated with heart disease?
### Key Findings:
- 📌 **54.5%** of patients in the dataset have heart disease
- 📌 Patients with heart disease are on average **younger (52.5 yrs)** than those without (56.6 yrs)
- 📌 **75% of female patients** have heart disease vs 45% of male patients
- 📌 **ST Depression (-0.43)** and **Max Heart Rate (+0.42)** are the strongest predictors
- 📌 Cholesterol is surprisingly a **weak predictor** in this dataset
- 📌 Patients with **Non-Anginal Pain** are more likely to have heart disease
- 📌 Only **20 outliers** detected across all numerical columns — dataset is clean

## 📈 Task 3: Data Visualization
 
### Charts Created:
| Chart | Type | Insight |
|---|---|---|
| Heart Disease Distribution | Bar Chart | 165 vs 138 patients |
| Gender vs Heart Disease | Grouped Bar | Women at higher risk (75%) |
| Age Distribution | Histogram | Younger patients more affected |
| Correlation Heatmap | Heatmap | ST Depression strongest predictor |
| Chest Pain Type | Grouped Bar | Non-Anginal Pain = higher risk |
| Age vs Max Heart Rate | Scatter Plot | Confirms age-heart rate relationship |

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodeAlpha_DataAnalytics.git
```
2. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```
3. Open the notebooks in order:
   - `Task2_EDA/task2_eda.ipynb`
   - `Task3_Visualization/task3_visualization.ipynb`

## 📝 Conclusion
This analysis reveals that **ST Depression, Max Heart Rate, and Major Vessels Count**
are the strongest predictors of heart disease in this dataset. Contrary to popular belief,
**cholesterol alone is not a strong predictor**. Women in this dataset show a
significantly higher rate of heart disease than men, highlighting the importance
of gender-specific medical screening.
